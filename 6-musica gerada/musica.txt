Yellow Starboy
(Inspired by Coldplay's Parachutes)

[Verse 1]
Oh darling, in the shadow of the moon,
Your love, a flame, lights up this empty room.
The stars above whisper tales of our embrace,
Forever in your arms, I’ve found my place.

[Chorus]
Yellow Starboy, shining in the night,
Your love’s a beacon, burning oh so bright.
Through waves of passion and the winds of time,
You’re my heart’s melody, my sweetest rhyme.

[Verse 2]
Across the ocean, where the wild winds call,
Our souls entwined, we’ll rise above it all.
Kisses like rain, they wash away the pain,
With every heartbeat, I’m whole again.

[Chorus]
Yellow Starboy, shining in the night,
Your love’s a beacon, burning oh so bright.
Through waves of passion and the winds of time,
You’re my heart’s melody, my sweetest rhyme.

[Bridge]
Oh baby, time is fleeting, yet with you, it’s still,
In your tender care, my world begins to heal.
A dream of you is where my courage grows,
In this garden of devotion, our love forever flows.

[Outro]
Yellow Starboy, under the timeless skies,
Your light will guide me, through lows and highs.
In this fleeting moment, we’re eternal, free,
A story of love, just you and me.
